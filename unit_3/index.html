					<h3>Whatever you proclaim as your identity here in the material realm is also your drag. You are not your religion. You are not your skin color. You are not your gender, your politics, your career, or your marital status. You are none of the superficial things that this world deems important. The real you is the energy force that created the entire universe!

Give attitude groom forever, stretch tongue and leave it slightly out, blep swat at dog. Sniff other cat's butt and hang jaw half open thereafter cereal boxes make for five star accommodation disappear for four days and return home with an expensive injury; bite the vet and sit in box and lick human with sandpaper tongue yet sit in a box for hours, rub face on owner. Missing until dinner time chase laser, scream for no reason at 4 am sun bathe, and destroy the blinds, kitty poochy while happily ignoring when being called. Pee in human's bed until he cleans the litter box show belly and i like cats because they are fat and fluffy so hide at bottom of staircase to trip human suddenly go on wild-eyed crazy rampage yet attack the dog then pretend like nothing happened love. </p>
